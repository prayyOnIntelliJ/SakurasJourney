## 🎮 About the Game

In *Sakura’s Journey*, players take on the role of **Kitsune Hime**, a fox-masked priestess bound to a divine spirit.

The game combines:
- Twin-stick shooter combat  
- Arena-based wave gameplay  
- Defensive objectives (e.g. protecting sacred sakura trees)  
- Progression and upgrade systems
